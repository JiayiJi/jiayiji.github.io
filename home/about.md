# About me

I hold a M.D. in Preventive Medicine at Fudan University, and I am currently pursuing my MS degree in biostatistics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. My goal is to become an outstanding data analyst.

* My medical training at Fudan University have offered me firm subject matter knowledge in medicine and public health.
* My statistical training at Columbia University have provided me with strong model building and assessing skills, solid Python, R, and SAS, SQL programming skills, as well as qualified independent thinking and problem solving skills. 
* My research experiences have equipped me with strong data analyzing, visualization, software using, and team working skills. 
* My internship experiences trained me well in interpreting and communicating statistical methods and results with both laymen and scientists.
