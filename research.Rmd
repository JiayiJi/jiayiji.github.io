### Identifying melanoma prognostic biomarkers by integrating imaging data and genetic data


I am conducting research with [Gen Li](https://sites.google.com/view/ligen) at the [Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics) 

This project involved three major stages:

1. Validation of previously identified breast cancer subtypes using an independent sample to integrate copy number and expression data. 

2. Identification of Differentially Methylated Regions to reduce dimensionality of methylation data in our sample. 

3. Identification of novel breast cancer subtypes by integrating copy number, gene expression, and methylation data using Ronglai Shen's integrative clustering algorithm ([iCluster](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/iClusterPlus.html)). We supervised input by selecting copy number and methylation features highly associated with gene expression.

Paper in progress.
